# Implementation

## How will this pilot work?

- This pilot will run from Dec 2024 to Mar 2026.

- Eligible users will be transferred from existing subscriptions into a central account.

- During this period, the project team will monitor outcomes and gather insights from both existing and new users of the centrally-managed tools. 

The success of the pilot will encourage the team to expand coverage to other relevant roles and teams.

## What do you need to do?


If you're **eligible**, you will **automatically** be granted access to the centrally-funded tools.

**What actions can you take?**

- You can check your eligiblity for the initiative. Refer to [Eligible Roles and Tools](/eligibility.md) for more information on eligibility.

- If you have questions or suggestions, you can join the   [#feedback-product-development-tools](https://govtech.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07UF60HY9Y) Slack channel to share your feedback.

## What is the impact to the subscription? 

As part of this transition, some subscription accounts may be updated based on role eligibility. Subscription Admins (SAs) should note that some subscriptions will be adjusted (down) to prevent duplicate charges. There will be a separate communication to convey the changes to the affected SAs.

?> SAs, please note that any licenses for eligible tools assigned to GovTechies will be moved from your account to a central GovTech  account.

If you do not already have a SHIP-HATS subscription, you will automatically be assigned license(s) for the tools relevant to your role.
