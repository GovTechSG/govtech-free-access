If you're eligible, the tool will display the group you belong to.

## ðŸ’¡ Reminders

- If you are not eligible for this pilot implementation, you can still continue using these tools with your existing [SHIP-HATS](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/devops/ship-hats/overview.html) subcription. If you are not an existing SHIP-HATS user, you can sign up via [TechBiz](https://portal.techbiz.suite.gov.sg/) and log in with [TechPass](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/). 

- While some roles may not be eligible for this initial phase, the goal is to expand the initiative over time. Feedback will be essential in making the tools more accessible and useful for collaboration. Your input will play a key role in shaping future phases of the rollout.

- For GovTechies (permanent and contract staff) in the specific roles mentioned above who are not eligible for the pilot, you can reach out to the team via Slack at the  [**#feedback-govtech-free-access**](https://govtech.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07UF60HY9Y) channel, and we will review on a case-by-case basis.

## Access for TIVO Users (Temporaries, Interns, Vendors, Others)

While GovTechies in the Free Access pilot will receive SHIP-HATS access (for Confluence, GitLab, and Jira), we understand that many teams work closely with TIVOs who also need these tools. To ensure they have the same access, we'll need your help with a separate subscription process.

If you need to arrange access for your TIVO team members,  GovTech teams will need to obtain licenses for them by subscribing to SHIP-HATS via the TechBiz portal. 

To do so, please follow these steps:

**1. AOR Submission for CIO Approval:** Prepare the AOR document and secure CIO approval (or the equivalent from your DD) for the subscription.

**2. Sign up for TechPass:** Log in to the TechPass portal to create a TechPass account for your TIVO. 

**3. Subscribe via TechBiz:** Log in to TechBiz to subscribe to the necessary SHIP-HATS licenses.

**4. Attach & Route Approval:** Attach the approved AOR and route the request to your CIO or DD equivalent for final approval.

**5. Onboard Users:** Once approved, onboard your TIVO users to SHIP-HATS.

For more guidance, please refer to [Subscribe to SHIP-HATS](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-docs/getting-started/subscription) and [Onboard to SHIP-HATS](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-docs/getting-started/onboard-to-ship-hats).

Following this process will help ensure that all GovTech team members who need accessâ€”even those not part of the Free Access pilotâ€”can work together effectively. We know this might mean a bit more work for some teams, and we appreciate your understanding.
