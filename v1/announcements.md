#### Free Access – Briefing Recap & Clarification

Thanks to everyone who joined our briefing on 1 April 2025! If you missed it or need a refresher, here’s the recap:

**What is Free Access?**

* It’s a centrally funded initiative (by the CIO Office and Core Engineering Productivity teams) to streamline tool access for GovTechies working in product development roles. We’re starting small, with a pilot focused on a few core roles — not everyone is covered yet.


**Who’s in the pilot?**

 If you're a GovTech staff (perm or contract) and your day-to-day role involves:

* Engineering (using GitLab, Jira, Confluence)
* Product or Delivery Management (using Jira, Confluence)
* Design (using Jira, Confluence)

…then you're likely part of the pilot group. 

Ongoing usage and feedback are key — they help us understand real demand and inform future decisions. We’re continuously reviewing data to guide how licenses are added or reassigned. Do note that if the usage of an assigned license is low, we will reassign the license to new users to ensure licenses are used where they’re most needed.

**If you're not included in the pilot right now**

The Free Access pilot is centrally managed and roles were selected based on current usage patterns and needs.  While some teams and roles aren’t part of this first phase, we’re continuously reviewing data to guide how access is expanded or reassigned.

* If your team is not part of first phase, you can continue to use licenses as part of your existing [SHIP-HATS](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/devops/ship-hats/overview.html) subscription (for GitLab, Jira, Confluence) or you can sign up for [SHIP-HATS](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-docs/getting-started/subscription) subscription via [TechBiz](https://portal.techbiz.suite.gov.sg/) and log in with [TechPass](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/).
* If you are in a role not covered as part of this pilot, you can sign up for [SHIP-HATS](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-docs/getting-started/subscription) subscription (for GitLab, Jira, Confluence) via [TechBiz](https://portal.techbiz.suite.gov.sg/) (log in with [TechPass](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/)). 
* If you're in a management or supervisory role, you can use these tools by signing up via [TechBiz](https://portal.techbiz.suite.gov.sg/) (log in with [TechPass](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/)). 

**Still unsure?** 

Check the docs (https://go.gov.sg/product-dev-tools). If you don’t see your scenario covered, reach out to us via <a href="https://govtech.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07UF60HY9Y">#feedback-govtech-free-access</a> — we’ll review on a case-by-case basis. Given limited licenses, we may not be able to support every request immediately. 

**Help us improve** 

Whether you’re already part of the pilot or hoping to join in the future, we’d love to hear your feedback: https://go.gov.sg/free-access-feedback. Please take 5 minutes to share your feedback. This will help us understand what’s working, what’s not, and how we can support you better.

### February 2025

#### Name change

The Product Development Tools initative has been renamed to Free Access. This change better reflects the programme's core purpose: providing eligible GovTechies with free access to essential development tools. 

While the name has changed, the initiative's objectives, benefits, scope, and operations remain the same. It will continue to be centrally funded by GovTech and managed by the CIO Office and Core Engineering Productivity teams. Eligible staff will still access the same tools through the same process, supporting GovTech's commitment to streamlined workflows and enhanced productivity.
