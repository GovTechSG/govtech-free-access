## Eligibility check 

To  quickly check if youâ€™re eligible, you can use this service: [**go.gov.sg/product-dev-tools-eligibility**](https://go.gov.sg/product-dev-tools-eligibility). 

If you're eligible, the tool will display the group you belong to.

Central funding will cover **specific GovTechies (direct and contract hires)** for the pilot implementation as shown in the table below: 

| Group | Role | Tools |
|---|---|--|
| Engineering | Engineers  | GitLab, Jira, Confluence |
| Product | Product Managers, Delivery Managers | Jira, Confluence |
| Design | Designers | Jira, Confluence |

For the following roles, you are not <u>currently not part of the pilot</u> and will need to [subscribe to the tools via SHIP-HATS Subscription](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-docs/getting-started/subscription):

- GovTechies seconded at agencies
- Agency users deployed at GovTech 
- Temporaries, Interns, Vendors, Others [[Learn more](#access-for-tivo-users-temporaries-interns-vendors-others)] 
- Vendors and augmented staff (in any role) with tech.gov.sg emails, e.g., ATS (23069), Contractors (23009), or 19024 [[Learn more](#access-for-tivo-users-temporaries-interns-vendors-others)] 

If you are in an eligible role and team but still do not have access to licenses under Free Access, this might be because we have limited licenses available as part of this pilot. We regularly clean up and reassign unused licenses to our colleagues who need it. Please read the  [Inactive Users](#inactive-users) section for more information.

## ðŸ’¡ Reminders

- If you are not eligible for this pilot implementation, you can still continue using these tools with your existing [SHIP-HATS](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/devops/ship-hats/overview.html) subcription. If you are not an existing SHIP-HATS user, you can sign up via [TechBiz](https://portal.techbiz.suite.gov.sg/) and log in with [TechPass](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/). 

- While some roles may not be eligible for this initial phase, the goal is to expand the initiative over time. Feedback will be essential in making the tools more accessible and useful for collaboration. Your input will play a key role in shaping future phases of the rollout.

- For GovTechies (permanent and contract staff) in the specific roles mentioned above who are not eligible for the pilot, you can reach out to the team via Slack at the  [**#feedback-govtech-free-access**](https://govtech.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07UF60HY9Y) channel, and we will review on a case-by-case basis.

## Inactive Users

Free Access was created to make your development work smoother and more efficient. Regular use of these licenses helps us understand how these tools benefit our GovTech community and ensures we can provide the right resources to everyone who needs them. 

To help us manage our licenses effectively and ensure they're available to those who need them most, we will be undergoing a regular clean-up process every 60 days. As part of this process, if a license remains unused after this period of 60 days, they will be reassigned to colleagues waiting to use them.  

Please share any feedback via <a href="https://govtech.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07UF60HY9Y">#feedback-govtech-free-access</a>  or [go.gov.sg/free-access-feedback](https://go.gov.sg/free-access-feedback).

## Access for TIVO Users (Temporaries, Interns, Vendors, Others)

While GovTechies in the Free Access pilot will receive SHIP-HATS access (for Confluence, GitLab, and Jira), we understand that many teams work closely with TIVOs who also need these tools. To ensure they have the same access, we'll need your help with a separate subscription process.

If you need to arrange access for your TIVO team members,  GovTech teams will need to obtain licenses for them by subscribing to SHIP-HATS via the TechBiz portal. 

To do so, please follow these steps:

**1. AOR Submission for CIO Approval:** Prepare the AOR document and secure CIO approval (or the equivalent from your DD) for the subscription.

**2. Sign up for TechPass:** Log in to the TechPass portal to create a TechPass account for your TIVO. 

**3. Subscribe via TechBiz:** Log in to TechBiz to subscribe to the necessary SHIP-HATS licenses.

**4. Attach & Route Approval:** Attach the approved AOR and route the request to your CIO or DD equivalent for final approval.

**5. Onboard Users:** Once approved, onboard your TIVO users to SHIP-HATS.

For more guidance, please refer to [Subscribe to SHIP-HATS](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-docs/getting-started/subscription) and [Onboard to SHIP-HATS](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-docs/getting-started/onboard-to-ship-hats).

Following this process will help ensure that all GovTech team members who need accessâ€”even those not part of the Free Access pilotâ€”can work together effectively. We know this might mean a bit more work for some teams, and we appreciate your understanding.
