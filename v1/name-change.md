# Rename to Free Access Initiative

We're happy to share that the Product Development Tools initiative is being renamed to the **Free Access Initiative**. This change has been made to better reflect the nature and purpose of the program.

?> **Note:** You may see the new name, Free Access Initiative, used in communications and documentation going forward.

## Reasons for the change

- **Improved Clarity**: The new name, Free Access Initiative, more accurately describes the core benefit of the programme - providing free access to essential development tools for eligible GovTechies.

- **Emphasis on Accessibility**: By highlighting the 'free access' aspect, we aim to underscore that these tools are available at no direct cost to individual projects or departments.

## Key points to note

- The initiative remains centrally funded and led by the CIO Office and the Core Engineering Productivity teams, in partnership with [Open Data Access](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/open-data-access/).
- While the tools are provided at no cost to individual GovTech staff or projects, it's important to understand that the initiative is funded centrally by GovTech.
- The core objectives and benefits of the initiative remain unchanged. We continue to aim for simplified access, streamlined workflows, and reduced barriers to productivity.

## What this means for you

- If you're an eligible GovTechie, you will continue to have access to the same suite of tools as before.
- The process for accessing these tools remains the same.
- You may see the new name, Free Access Initiative, used in communications and documentation going forward.

We believe this new name better represents our commitment to providing GovTech staff with the resources they need to build impactful products efficiently.
