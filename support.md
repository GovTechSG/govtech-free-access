## Frequently asked questions

### Eligibility and access

- **What is the Free Access initiative?**

    The Free Access initiative is designed to provide eligible GovTechies (e.g., Product Managers, Engineers, Designers) with centrally funded licenses for selected development tools, such as GitLab, Jira, and Confluence. Instead of individual teams or projects managing separate tool licenses, GovTech will centrally cover the costs, simplifying access to essential tools for eligible roles. More details on the tools covered will be shared as the rollout progresses.

- **How do I know if I am eligible?**

    We've built a service for you to check if you're eligible for Free Access. You can check it out here: http://go.gov.sg/product-dev-tools-eligibility. Please note that this initiative is currently a pilot for selected roles and teams in GovTech.

- **What does it mean to be 'Not Eligible'?**

    If you are not eligible for this pilot implementation, you can still continue using these tools with your existing [SHIP-HATS](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/devops/ship-hats/overview.html) subscription. If you are not an existing SHIP-HATS user, you can sign up via [TechBiz](https://portal.techbiz.suite.gov.sg/) and login with [TechPass](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/).

- **Are contractors eligible?**

    No, contractorsâ€”including those hired under Bulk Tender 19024, 23009, or 23069â€”are not eligible for this initiative. The centrally funded tools are available only to full-time GovTech staff in eligible roles.

- **Why aren't Data Scientists included in the initiative?**

    Currently, this is a pilot initiative launched with a limited scope in mind. While this is just the beginning, we aim to gather feedback from GovTechies and observe if the tools are well utilised when we centralise and streamline access. Data scientists can still onboard the tools via TechBiz subscription. Those who already have access to SHIP-HATS will continue to have access via their TechBiz subscriptions. For example, a team of 10 people (5 engineers and 5 data scientists) may only need to subscribe for 5 instead of the previous 10, where the subscription and access to tools for the 5 engineers are managed centrally.

- **I'm a Delivery Manager not in the eligible list. Can I be added?**

    We're currently running the pilot for specific roles and groups in GovTech, and we do not have any short-term plans to add more users. The team will be gathering insights from the pilot groups before we evaluate how to extend the coverage to other relevant roles and groups in GovTech. In the meantime, you can still subscribe to SHIP-HATS via TechBiz or continue as a regular subscriber (if you already have access).

- **Can Cloud Infra Engineers be part of the Pilot?**

    We're rolling out this initiative to a pilot group of users and roles, but it does not affect how existing users of SHIP-HATS will access the tools. Your team should not be affected unless there are members who have yet to be onboarded to SHIP-HATS subscription via TechBiz. With the pilot, we're looking to gather more insights about how GovTechies are collaborating before we consider expanding to more roles and groups in GovTech. While we cannot add more participants to the pilot yet, this will be a possibility as we track its success.

- **Are users with @gt.tech.gov.sg emails eligible for Free Access?**

    No, the Free Access initiative only covers eligible full-time GovTech staff with @tech.gov.sg emails (managed in WOG Entra ID). Having a @gt.tech.gov.sg email alone doesn't guarantee Free Access eligibility.

- **I'm an engineer who is holding concurrent roles or I am a dual appointment holder. Am I eligible for this?**

    If you are a dual appointment holder or holding concurrent roles, you are currently not eligible for the Free Access initiative.

### Subscription management

- **Will there be updates to subscription accounts?**

    During this transition, TechBiz subscription accounts will be updated as licensed users are moved to a centrally managed GovTech subscription. Subscription Admins (SAs) should be aware that not all subscriptions will be affected, but licenses assigned in your accounts will be reduced when users are transferred. An automated communication has been sent to affected SAs with detailed information about these changes.


- **What if I don't have a SHIP-HATS subscription?**

    To qualify for the Free Access initiative, you need to be in an eligible role from the teams selected for the pilot. If you do not have an existing SHIP-HATS subscription, you will automatically be assigned license(s) according to your role. For subscription accounts with eligible GovTechies, the licenses for GitLab, Jira, and Confluence assigned to them will be moved out of the existing account into a central GovTech account.

- **Will this affect SHIP-HATS subscription costs?**

    Yes, there will be an impact on costs for some SHIP-HATS subscriptions, particularly for eligible GovTechies whose tools are now covered under the Free Access initiative. For these users, the charges will no longer be incurred by their previous subscription accounts, and the subscription plans for those accounts will be adjusted downward accordingly to prevent duplicate charges. However, SHIP-HATS as a product will continue to follow its existing subscription and pricing model for all other users, including external agencies.

- **Does the statement "Subscription admins may find that your users have been moved out from your subscriptions" affect user rights management?**

    No, this only means that user management on TechBiz is moved out from the existing subscription accounts and will be managed in a central GovTech subscription for the pilot users. Their access to the tools will not change, and permissions in GitLab, Jira, and Confluence remain decoupled from user management on TechBiz.

### Tools and access coverage

- **Does this cover all SHIP-HATS tools?**

    No, this initiative does not cover all SHIP-HATS tools. It only includes selected toolsâ€”specifically GitLab, Jira, and Confluenceâ€”that are part of SHIP-HATS and used for product development. These tools will be centrally funded for eligible roles in GovTech, but SHIP-HATS, as a whole, will continue under its existing subscription and pricing model.


- **Why split between GitLab and Atlassian tools?**

    We're currently operating this as a pilot initiative, and the decision to assign GitLab to engineers by default was due to the primary purpose of each tool. Confluence and Jira will be the main collaboration tools for knowledge management, while GitLab emphasizes software delivery. We appreciate that GitLab issues and wikis can be used by non-engineering roles, but the current licensing may not be favorable for equipping non-engineers with GitLab. This is a pilot initiative, and the team is open to feedback about making better sensible defaults for everyone.

- **I'm trying to assign GitLab license to myself but system claims I'm already under another subscription. What should I do?**

    If the system indicates you're already in another subscription, it means you already have a license assigned, so there's no need to get another license (maximum 1 license per user). For project creation in your sub-group, you need at least a developer role. Check your role in your sub-group (go to sidebar > manage > members > search your name). If you don't have at least a developer role, you'll need to ask an owner or maintainer to grant you one.

- **What does the central funding include and how do I create spaces?**

    You will not have subscription rights for the subscription funded for you. However, you have two options:
    - You can create a new SHIP-HATS account with a $0 base subscription, without any base or add-on
    - Another Subscription Admin can add you as a Secondary Admin or Project Admin to their own subscription. This will allow you to create and manage a new Confluence space.

### Technical support

- **Having trouble accessing Atlassian?**

    If you see "Looks like your administrator has marked your account as inactive", you can submit the SHIP-HATS Atlassian User Account Reactivation Form. This should provide an automatic response and activate your account if you have a valid SHIP-HATS Atlassian license.

- **I've checked that I am eligible but don't have access to sgtechstack.atlassian.net. What should I do?**

    If your account might have been deactivated, you can use our self-service reactivation tool: https://go.gov.sg/ship-hats-atlassian-self-service.

### Impact on other agencies

- **Will this affect other government agencies?**

    No, this initiative is specific to GovTechies and does not affect the SHIP-HATS subscription model for other government agencies. Government agencies using SHIP-HATS will continue to subscribe under the existing pricing model, and the Free Access initiative is only applicable to eligible roles within GovTech.

- **Are SHIP-HATS tools going to be free?**

    No, SHIP-HATS tools will not be available for free. This initiative will centralise the management of access to certain tools but will only apply to eligible GovTechies. SHIP-HATS will continue to operate under its existing subscription and pricing model.
