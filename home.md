# Free Access

The Free Access initiative aims to simplify and centralise access to [essential development tools](tools.md) for GovTech product teams, streamlining workflows, and reducing barriers to productivity.

Launched in FY24, these tools will be made available to [eligible GovTechies](eligibility.md)  upon onboarding, enabling teams to focus on  building impactful products.

This initiative is centrally funded and led by the CIO Office and the Core Engineering Productivity teams, in partnership with [Open Data Access](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/open-data-access/). 

## The purpose of this initiative

![why-we-are-doing-this](assets/whyarewedoingthis.png)

Our current decentralised approach to procuring development tools has created some challenges, including:

- **Long procurement processes:** Without central expertise, navigating procurement can be time-consuming.
- **Reduced productivity:** GovTechies transitioning between product teams often face delays in gaining access to  tools.
- **Cost inefficiencies:** Decentralisation limits the benefits of bulk purchasing and other cost-saving opportunities.

This initiative seeks to reduce these challenges, so that GovTech engineers and product teams can focus on core activities rather than navigating tool acquisition and budgeting processes.

!> **Important:** To ensure responsible use of our shared resources, tools that are not actively used over time may be reallocated to others who can benefit from them. For more information, refer to [Usage guidelines](guidelines.md). Due to overwhelming demand, some tools have already reached their license limits. We appreciate your patience as we work to process access requests.
