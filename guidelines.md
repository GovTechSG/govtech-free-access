# Usage guidelines  

To ensure resources are optimised, tool usage is monitored by the CIO Office.  

The following policies apply:  

- Access to any standard tool that **remains inactive for more than 60 consecutive days will be automatically revoked** without prior notification.  
- If access has been revoked, a new request may be submitted to regain it.  

This policy is intended to ensure that licenses are actively used and remain available for those who need them.
